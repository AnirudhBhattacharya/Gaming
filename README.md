Speed Racer Game is a project developed on C# using Unity Framework. I was inspired by the old 90's car racing video game to develop this game. I have submitted this as a final submission for the "Game Development" course module in Semester 1 of my Master's program. This is a single player game that enables user to score points while tackling obstacles that come on the way. User can also mute the background sound or pause the game. It all starts with the Start Countdown. Unleash the childhood fun ;)
